# Learn Python The Hard Way

A journey to gain exposure to Python starting on 5/24/2016.

I found Learn Python The Hard Way while working with a coworker at Progress Software, who was learning Python as they worked. I saw the link, found it interesting, and decided to go through the exercises offered on the website.
